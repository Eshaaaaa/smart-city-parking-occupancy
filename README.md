## Introduction
In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can determine whether a parking spot is occupied or empty based on images. This can be useful for smart city applications where real-time parking occupancy data is needed.

## Usage

1. **Load and preprocess the dataset:**
   Follow the steps in `parking_occupancy.ipynb` to load and preprocess the dataset.

2. **Train the model:**
   Train the model using the provided code in `parking_occupancy.ipynb`.

3. **Evaluate the model:**
   Evaluate the model using the test set.

4. **Make predictions:**
   Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.
